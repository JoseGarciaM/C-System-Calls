# C - System Calls

## Practical Example

Write a C program that starts from a given directory and goes down the file tree, recording the sizes of all the files it finds. When finished, you will need to print a histogram of the file sizes, using a specified urn width as a parameter (for example, for an urn value of 1024, all files with size between 0 and 1023 are placed in a urn, those of 1024 to 2047 in another and so on).

## Instalation

```bash
gcc main.c -o main
```
